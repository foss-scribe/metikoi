Metikoi is an adventure role playing game for one of more players, in which you explore an exotic and deadly world inspired by Ancient Greece, Rome and the Levant.

While the game is based on Knave by Ben Milton, it draws material and inspiration from many other [sources](sources.md). It began life as a collection of hacks to make Knave more suited to an Ancient/Classical settings instead of Medieval, and to run games as a soloist. The game was adapted by [Chris Rosser](https://chrisrosser.net).
